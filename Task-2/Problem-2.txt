Problem 2:
1.First 3 numbers of the Fibonacci series are constant.
0 , 1 , 1
2. Consider “0” as the 0th term and 1 as 1st and second 1 as 2nd term.
3. Input the required term in Fibonacci series. (let it be “n”).
4. If “n” is not equal to zero (because the number of terms can only be in positive signed numbers and 0 is not positive nor negative)
Then 
It will give the output as the required Fibonacci number.
Else
It will give output “0”.
Final output be like:
If input = 0; answer =0
If input =1; answer =1
.
.
If input =11; answer = 89
.
.
