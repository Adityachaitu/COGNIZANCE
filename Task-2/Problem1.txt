Problem1:
1.Enter a number (let it be “n”).
2. while “n” is greater than 9
Then
Add the digits until it will be converted to a single digit.
3.After attaining the single digit (let it be “t”). 
If   t =3 or 6 or 9
Then 
It is divisible by 3 and 
Gives output “TRUE”
Or 
It is not divisible by 3 and
Gives output “FALSE”
